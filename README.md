You can see the projet in live here : 

This projet was a great exercice for me . I could practice objects constructor, and others concenpts in js. I could also practice css concepts as Flex,grid,position combine them or at least pick the best for me in the required moment. I also used mozila dev tool to search for information on some problems that I encountered.

I still have doubts about how I organized my Js code and css. This is something that I need to remediate to make my code better. 

In conclusion there are a lot to practice in Js basic concepts and css . I did win a lot of knowledge from this projet but I'm still far for enough to be confident in my skills.
